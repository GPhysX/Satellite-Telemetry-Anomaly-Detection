# Satellite-Telemetry-Anomaly-Detection
Code repo for my independent study into anomaly detection for LASP satellite telemetry

## Link to Paper
Read the research paper, _Unsupervised Machine Learning for Spacecraft Anomaly Detection in WebTCAD_, [here](https://github.com/sapols/Satellite-Telemetry-Anomaly-Detection/blob/master/Paper/Unsupervised%20Machine%20Learning%20for%20Spacecraft%20Anomaly%20Detection%20in%20WebTCAD.pdf).

## Brief Directory Descriptions

Below is a brief description of each directory:
 - [Data](https://github.com/sapols/Satellite-Telemetry-Anomaly-Detection/tree/master/Data): Contains the five datasets used in this research 
 - [Metadata](https://github.com/sapols/Satellite-Telemetry-Anomaly-Detection/tree/master/Metadata): Contains metadata for the five datasets used in this research 
 - [Paper](https://github.com/sapols/Satellite-Telemetry-Anomaly-Detection/tree/master/Paper): The research paper and the LaTex code behind it
 - [demo](https://github.com/sapols/Satellite-Telemetry-Anomaly-Detection/tree/master/demo): Contains the two Jupyter notebooks that executed the demonstrations in this research
 - [explore](https://github.com/sapols/Satellite-Telemetry-Anomaly-Detection/tree/master/explore): Contains various Jupyter notebooks that were not actually a part of the research but detect anomalies in the five datasets using a subset of techniques (ARIMA and simple statistics)
 - [save](https://github.com/sapols/Satellite-Telemetry-Anomaly-Detection/tree/master/save): Contains all the data and plots produced by the demonstrations in demo
